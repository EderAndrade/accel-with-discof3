# accel-with-discof3

This project is based on in my software architecture and stm32f3discovery that has LSM303AGR embedded.

I used IAR as IDE and C language, but if you prefer, you can totally use your IDE prefered 'cause this architecture is full independent of IDE and hardware.

I used as well a library for LSM303AGR produced by STMicroelectronics: https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/stm32cubef3.html

Check this out!
